# Coding Challenge
This coding challenge tests problem-solving, execution, communication, and documentation. Documentation is essential, and the solution should provide specific instructions for building and running it. 

Solution architecture design is more art than a skill, so be creative and have fun.

## Challenge Statement
### Scenario
Your company is experiencing a rapid growth in user activity, generating a constant stream of data from various sources. This includes website clickstream data, user interactions with a mobile app, and real-time sensor readings from your infrastructure.

### Your Responsibilities
You are tasked with designing and implementing a real-time data pipeline using Apache Kafka as the central messaging system. This pipeline will ingest data from these diverse sources, process it in real-time, and store it in a scalable cloud data lake. The data lake will serve as the foundation for future analytics and machine learning applications.
* Data Ingestion with Kafka: Design and implement real-time data pipelines using Kafka topics for each data source. Consider data format handling (e.g., JSON, Avro) and potential pre-processing steps within Kafka producers.
