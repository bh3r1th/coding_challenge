# Coding Challenge
This coding challenge tests problem-solving, execution, communication, and documentation. Documentation is essential, and the solution should provide specific instructions for building and running it. 

Solution architecture design is more art than a skill, so be creative and have fun.

## Challenge Statement
### Scenario
You are tasked with architecting  and implementing a real-time data lake on a cloud platform (your choice -  AWS, GCP, or Azure) to ingest, process, and store this real-time data stream. This data lake will serve as the foundation for future analytics and machine learning applications.
